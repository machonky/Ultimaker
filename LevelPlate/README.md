UM1 Plate Levelling script.

I hated continually connecting a PC to the UM1 just to level the plate so I 
wrote some GCode to assist in the process.

The head will cycle around the plate twice. 

The first pass is to adjust the levelling screws. The locations chosen on the 
plate will allow access to the screws while being as close to the relevant 
edge as possible. You need to use the "Resume Print" menu option to move to
the next location.

The second pass will pause at each location for 5 seconds allowing easy verification
of the head position without having to manually operate the machine.

Enjoy.
